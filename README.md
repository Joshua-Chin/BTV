# BTV Solver
This program computes optimal ability setups for the BillyTV dice based web game.

## The Game
In the BTV minigame, you start with a fixed number of points to buy abilities with.
Each ability corresponds to a single die and can only be rolled once.
These abilities can be used to attempt challenges.

Each challenge has a target (the minimum to pass the challenge) and a maximum ability count.
To attempt the challenge, select a number of abilities and roll the corresponding dice.
If the total is greater than the target, then you pass the challenge and recieve a reward.
These rewards can improve your dice, increase the ability limit, or help you in the finale.
Challenges can be attempted in any order, and can be retried if you fail.

After defeating all 11 challenges, you roll your remaining abilities in the grand finale.
Your total score is the result of that roll.
